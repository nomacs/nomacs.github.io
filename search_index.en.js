half of not found :)\na new feature was introduced which is very useful for us\nand we think it may be useful for those of you who also work in the computer vision field.\nWe are now able to load the .vec file of the OpenCV Cascade Classifier.\nSo you can easily control if the patches you trained,\nor the patches OpenCV created automatically are correct.\nOf course we have not added the .vec extension to the default settings of nomacs, because there exists a lot of other vec files.\nThus, you have to add the extension to nomacs manually.\nYou can do this by opening the “File” -&gt; “Add Image Format”&nbsp; dialog.\nThen you can drag&amp;drop your file into the dialog or use the browse to the file.\nAfter clicking add you have to name the new file format.\nAfter that you can open your .vec files with nomacs.\nDue to some limitations of the fileformat nomacs assumes that the patches are square\nand thus if you open a file containing non-square nomacs is unable to load it.\nIf you want to use non-square patches you have to specify the size in the file name.\nYou can do this by adding “-w[width]-h[height]”.\nSo for example you have to name your file “samples-w35-h25.vec”.\nHave fun with this feature and may it simplify your training step\n— the nomacs team","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/2-0-2-supports-vec-file/","title":"2.0.2 supports .vec

different file formats.\nApparently it turned out, that we already support most of them but we have not added the file extension to our file filter.\nThis is especially true for RAW formats of image files,\nwe just simple don’t know all extensions of all manufacturers and we don’t have sample images from all of them for testing.\nBut there is a simple solution: you can easily try to add new files formats to nomacs.\nYou just have to use File -&gt; Add Image Format\n– this opens a dialog where you can drop (or load) your images and nomacs will tell you if the file extension is supported.\nIf it is supported it will display the image.\nAfter adding the file format you can use our File Filter settings in the preferences dialog\nto set nomacs as default viewer for these images.\nIf you have successfully added a new file format,\nplease drop us a note in our bug tracker and we will add the extension to nomacs.\nIf nomacs is unable to load you file format, please add a new feature request.\nIf possible attach also the image to the request so we can test it easily.\nOpen the “Add Image Format” Dialog\nand drop or load your image\n— the nomacs

since version 2.4.\nYou can open the bach processing from the Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Batch Processing.\nCurrently there are four different processing modes (Copy/Rename | Image Format Conversion | Image Resize | Transforming).\nFirst you can choose the directory and select the files you want to process.\nFile selection is similar to the thumbnail preview\n(select multiple files using CTRL, hold SHIFT to select files consecutively or hit CTRL+A to select all files of a folder).\nYou can additionally filter a subset using search terms or regular expressions\n(in the example below all files are chosen which start with a lower case character).\nAfter selecting the files to be processed you can click the Icon Add Files to the File List.\nIf you open the File List Tab, you can also drop multiple folders to select their files for processing.\nHaving selected the files to be processed, you can choose an output directory.\nThe output panel allows you to choose the old filename or rename all processed files.\nThe screenshot shows a file conversion where 87 files are converted to png.\nCopy/Rename\nThe Output panel allows you to choose an output directory and rename/convert files.\nYou can choose a custom filename.\nDo not forget to add a sequence number such that the filenames are still unique.\nThe filename preview picks a selected image and shows the old and the new filename accordingly.\nIf input and output directory are the same, images will be renamed in place.\nOtherwise the images are copied and renamed.

You can either support us by:\ntranslating nomacs to your language\nporting nomacs to a system not yet supported (it should compile on every system that is supported by Qt)\ncoding (bug fixes &amp; additional features are always welcome)\nPlease see the How to Contribute page.\nHow to translate nomacs?\nCheck out our short introduction on how to translate nomacs into your language.\nDoes nomacs support Windows XP and/or Vista?\nThe answer is yes and no.\nSo neither Windows XP nor Vista are supported in future developments since nomacs 3.0.\nHowever, nomacs 2.4.6 is a pretty stable version which you can use on these operating systems.\nHow to make an unattended installation of nomacs?\nWhen using Windows you can make an unattended installation of
