half of not found :)\na new feature was introduced which is very useful for us\nand we think it may be useful for those of you who also work in the computer vision field.\nWe are now able to load the .vec file of the OpenCV Cascade Classifier.\nSo you can easily control if the patches you trained,\nor the patches OpenCV created automatically are correct.\nOf course we have not added the .vec extension to the default settings of nomacs, because there exists a lot of other vec files.\nThus, you have to add the extension to nomacs manually.\nYou can do this by opening the “File” -&gt; “Add Image Format”&nbsp; dialog.\nThen you can drag&amp;drop your file into the dialog or use the browse to the file.\n\nAfter clicking add you have to name the new file format.\nAfter that you can open your .vec files with nomacs.\n\nDue to some limitations of the fileformat nomacs assumes that the patches are square\nand thus if you open a file containing non-square nomacs is unable to load it.\nIf you want to use non-square patches you have to specify the size in the file name.\nYou can do this by adding “-w[width]-h[height]”.\nSo for example you have to name your file “samples-w35-h25.vec”.\nHave fun with this feature and may it simplify your training step\n— the nomacs team\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/2-0-2-supports-vec-file/","title":"2.0.2 supports .vec

different file formats.\nApparently it turned out, that we already support most of them but we have not added the file extension to our file filter.\nThis is especially true for RAW formats of image files,\nwe just simple don’t know all extensions of all manufacturers and we don’t have sample images from all of them for testing.\nBut there is a simple solution: you can easily try to add new files formats to nomacs.\nYou just have to use File -&gt; Add Image Format\n– this opens a dialog where you can drop (or load) your images and nomacs will tell you if the file extension is supported.\nIf it is supported it will display the image.\nAfter adding the file format you can use our File Filter settings in the preferences dialog\nto set nomacs as default viewer for these images.\nIf you have successfully added a new file format,\nplease drop us a note in our bug tracker and we will add the extension to nomacs.\nIf nomacs is unable to load you file format, please add a new feature

supports batch processing since version 2.4.\nYou can open the bach processing from the Menu &gt; Tools &gt; Batch Processing.\nCurrently there are four different processing modes (Copy/Rename | Image Format Conversion | Image Resize | Transforming).\nFirst you can choose the directory and select the files you want to process.\nFile selection is similar to the thumbnail preview\n(select multiple files using CTRL, hold SHIFT to select files consecutively or hit CTRL+A to select all files of a folder).\nYou can additionally filter a subset using search terms or regular expressions\n(in the example below all files are chosen which start with a lower case character).\nAfter selecting the files to be processed you can click the Icon Add Files to the File List.\nIf you open the File List Tab, you can also drop multiple folders to select their files for processing.\nHaving selected the files to be processed, you can choose an output directory.\nThe output panel allows you to choose the old filename or rename all processed files.\nThe screenshot shows a file conversion where 87 files are converted to png.\n\nCopy/Rename\nThe Output panel allows you to choose an output directory and rename/convert files.\nYou can choose a custom filename.\nDo not forget to add a sequence number such that the filenames are still unique.\nThe filename preview picks a selected image and shows the old and the new filename accordingly.\nIf input and output directory are the same, images will be renamed in place.\nOtherwise the images are copied and renamed. This action will not change the image encoding.\n\n  \n  the output panel\n\nImage Conversion\nIf you want to convert images to a specific output format (e.g. PNG) you can change the Keep Extension drop down to Convert To.\nThen select your preferred format.\nYou can choose any format which is supported by nomacs.\n\n  \n  batch convert images\n\nResize/Transform\nClick the + next to Resize/Transform to apply an image transform.\nIf you e.g. want to downsample all images of a folder, you can choose Long Side in the resize panel.\nThen enter the desired side length in pixel.\nThis option will resize the image such that the width of panorama images\nor the height of portrait images will be set to the desired pixel length.\nIf you check Shrink Only images which have a lower long side than the desired length will not be resized.\n\n  \n  batch resize\n\nThe Transform panel allows you to rotate or flip all images.\nThe gray text next to the panel title indicates if a panel is active or not.\nThe example below shows a configuration which resizes all images by 50% and then rotates them by 180°.\n\n  \n  batch transform\n\nProcessing\nAfter you configured the batch processing according to your needs you can hit OK.\nA progress bar will appear which indicates the percentage of images already processed.\nIf you notice a wrong configuration, you can cancel the processing.\nAll images processed will stay the same then but the processing is stopped immediately.\n\n  \n  processing images\n\nAll processing actions are logged.\nChoose Show Log to see the status of the processing.\nYou can see the status of every batch module and check if it was processed successfully.\nPlease check the batch configuration before Processing especially\nif you check Overwrite Existing files since these actions cannot be reverted.\n\n  \n  log file\n\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/batch-processing/","title":"Batch Processing"},"https://nomacs.org/blog/blackout/":{"body":"nomacs was down for the last two days – sorry\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/blackout/","title":"blackout"},"https://nomacs.org/blog/brand-your-nomacs/":{"body":"Since nomacs 3, you can change the background image which is displayed on start-up.\nYou just need to place an image called ‘bg.png’ into a folder together with your nomacs.exe.\nHere is how this looks like:\n\nIf you add a second file named ‘bgf.png’, the splash screen of the frameless mode will be overwritten.\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/brand-your-nomacs/","title":"Brand your nomacs"},"https://nomacs.org/blog/but-which-image-format-should-i-take/":{"body":"Since we see a lot of people choosing the wrong image formats on a daily basis, we have created a short cheat sheet for you.\nThough JPEG is probably the easiest way to archive your pictures,\nthere are several incentives to choose another image format depending on the image content or purpose.\n(You can also download&nbsp;the cheat sheet)\n\n  \n  Image formats for photos\n\n\n  \n  Image formats for illustrations\n\n– the nomacs team\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/but-which-image-format-should-i-take/","title":"But which image format should I take?"},"https://nomacs.org/blog/cocktail/":{"body":"\ntake a close look at your browser’s address bar : )\n– the nomacs team\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/cocktail/","title":"Welcome to the Image Lounge"},"https://nomacs.org/blog/command-line-options/":{"body":"we have improved/added command line options for nomacs:\n\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/command-line-options/","title":"Command Line Options"},"https://nomacs.org/blog/critical-bugfix/":{"body":"we have found a critical bug which – in some cases – prevents nomacs from starting correctly.\nIf you experience this issue, we would recommend to update nomacs to version 1.6.3.\n&nbsp;The issue applies only to the Windows versions.\nUsers of other OS can safely enjoy version 1.6.2.\nSorry for any inconveniences caused.\nFor the Matlab users who do not enjoy the default image display behavior of Matlab:\nthis script allows you to directly display images in nomacs.\n\n— the nomacs team\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/critical-bugfix/","title":"Critical Bugfix"},"https://nomacs.org/blog/demo-video/":{"body":"\nfor all who want to know what the sync is all about…\n","id":"https://nomacs.org/blog/demo-video/","title":"Demo Video"},"https://nomacs.org/blog/features-features-features/":{"body":"since there were (hardly any) no bugs in the last release we focused on new features and skipped again at least one bug fix release.\nthe highly praised features include:\n\nMulti Page TIFF support – with export &amp;

interface\n(if your language is not available, please send us a message).\nIt is obligatory to register at crowdin.net.\nYour translation will be submitted immediately and will become available to all users\nat the next day using the menu ?-&gt;”Update translations”.\nFirst translate “nmc::DkGlobalSettingsWidget” -&gt; “English” to the name of your language\ne.g. for german “English” is translated to “Deutsch”.\nThis string will be displayed in the preferences when choosing the languages.\nSometime the suggestions of crowdin are fine, but often you have to change them.\nYou can filter for untranslated strings, or machine translated string.\nDifferent characters are used within the strings:\n\n“&amp;”: The ampersand is used as mnemonic in the menu.\nThis means it is the shortcut when pressing the alt-modified.\nFor example: The “File” menu is translated as “&amp;File”,\nthis means the “F” is underlined in the menu and ALT+F can be used as shortcut to access this menu.\n“%1”: This string is always replaced with strings which are needed for a meaningful message.\nIn most of the cases these strings are either image names or directories\ne.g. “Could not save: %1″, here %1 will be replaced with the image name.\nNote: due to some reasons we also have to use %1 for the “°” sign like for rotating the image: “9&amp;0%1 Clockwise”\n\nIf the string or its context is unclear,\nyou can use the comment field in the web interface for questions and we will try to answer them as fast as possible.\nHow to apply  a new Translation on your machine\n\n\ndownload the language file from crowdin\n\n\ninstall Qt Creator (pick the open source installer)\n\n\nopen a command line and cd to the directory with the downloaded translations (*.ts)\n\n\nThen type (assuming you downloaded the Catalan translation):\n\n\nWindows (change the Qt folder accordingly)\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you should have a file named nomacs_ca_ES.qm in the same directory.\nCopy this file to the

You can either support us by:\n\ntranslating nomacs to your language\nporting nomacs to a system not yet supported (it should compile on every system that is supported by Qt)\ncoding (bug fixes &amp; additional features are always welcome)\n\nPlease see the How to Contribute page.\nHow to translate nomacs?\nHere is a short introduction how to translate nomacs to your language.\nDoes nomacs support Windows XP and/or Vista?\nThe answer is yes and no.\nSo neither Windows XP nor Vista are supported in future developments since nomacs 3.0.\nHowever, nomacs 2.4.6 is a pretty stable version which you can use on these operating systems.\nHow to make an unattended installation of nomacs?\nWhen using Windows you can make an unattended installation of
