nomacs uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/nomacs-neo) as tool for translations. This is the preferred method, but
if you want to use a different tool or learn more about Crowdin check the 
[Translation Manual](https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs/blob/master/ImageLounge/manuals/Translation.md)
on github.
